#### Getting Started 

Using Gallerify is very, very easy. You can either allow the plugin to repalce the default WordPress Gallery on the Gallerify Settings (Dashboard > Settings > Gallerify Settings) or you can use the custom Gallerify shortcode to load the galleries. Just use the shortcode [gallerify] and put all the images inside the shortcode. You can also use the attribute <em>title</em> to add a title to the Gallerify gallery. Here's an example:

<blockquote>
[gallerify title="Screenshots"]
Put image tags here!
[/gallerify]
</blockquote>

See? It's that simple!

#### Responsive 

Gallerify is a responsive gallery plugin for WordPress. No matter what device your reader is using, the gallery will look beautiful in any display size. How about touch devices? Gallerify also supports touch input, keyboard input and more! It's one of the best responsive gallery plugin you can get on WordPress!

#### Fast

We use an advanced algorithm to load your posts' galleries faster. WordPress' default gallery feature needs to require a lot of database queries which causes server loads for websites. However, our plugin doesn't need to acquire any data from the WordPress Database, making the plugin load faster! 

#### Admin Panel

Gallerify comes with an admin panel where you can customize any settings you want. Don't like a feature? Just disable it! Don't like the color? Just customize it to your needs!
